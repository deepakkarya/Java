In Java Streams, both `map` and `forEach` are commonly used methods, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a breakdown of their differences and use cases:

### `map` Method

- **Purpose**: The `map` method is used to transform each element of the stream into another form. It takes a `Function` as an argument and applies this function to each element in the stream, producing a new stream of transformed elements.
- **Return Type**: It returns a new stream with the transformed elements.
- **Common Use**: It's used when you want to convert or modify the elements of the stream.
- **Example**: If you have a stream of integers and you want to convert each integer to its string representation, you can use `map`.

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
    List<String> numberStrings = numbers.stream()
        .map(String::valueOf)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
        ```

        ### `forEach` Method

        - **Purpose**: The `forEach` method is used to perform an action on each element of the stream. It takes a `Consumer` as an argument and applies this action to each element in the stream.
        - **Return Type**: It returns `void`, meaning it doesn't produce a new stream or collection; instead, it just performs the action.
        - **Common Use**: It's used when you want to execute some side effect for each element, like printing values or modifying external states.
        - **Example**: If you want to print each integer from a stream, you would use `forEach`.

        ```java
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
            numbers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
            ```

            ### Key Differences

            1. **Transformation vs. Action**:
            - `map` is about transforming data and returns a new stream of the transformed elements.
            - `forEach` is about performing an action on each element and does not return a stream.

            2. **Intermediate vs. Terminal Operation**:
            - `map` is an intermediate operation. It returns a new stream and can be chained with other stream operations.
            - `forEach` is a terminal operation. It ends the stream pipeline and triggers the processing of the stream.

            3. **Use Cases**:
            - Use `map` when you need to produce a modified version of the data.
            - Use `forEach` when you need to perform some side-effecting operation for each element.

            ### Example of Both Together

            You can use `map` followed by `forEach` if you need to transform elements and then perform an action on them:

            ```java
            List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
                numbers.stream()
                .map(n -> n * 2)        // Transform each element (e.g., double each number)
                .forEach(System.out::println); // Print each transformed element
                ```

                In this example, `map` doubles each number, and `forEach` prints each doubled number.
